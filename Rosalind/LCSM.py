Problem: A common substring of a collection of strings is
         a substring of every member of the collection. We
         say that a common substring is a longest common
         substring if there does not exist a longer common
         substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring
         of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as
         long as possible; in this case, "CGTA" is a longest
         common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".
         
         Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily
         unique; for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are
         both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at
       most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.

Return: A longest common substring of the collection.
        (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)

Sample Dataset: >Rosalind_1
                GATTACA
                >Rosalind_2
                TAGACCA
                >Rosalind_3
                ATACA

Sample Output:  AC
